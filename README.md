# Calculator

# Summary
This is a calculator I created using Claude.ai for my Innovative Technologies for Design course

# About
I created this wide-format pink calculator using Claude.ai. This tool combines basic arithmetic with scientific functions like trigonometry and logarithms, featuring an intuitive color-coded layout where different shades of pink distinguish between number keys, operators, and advanced functions. The interface supports both mouse and keyboard input, with visual feedback for every operation.

# Reflection
I have really grown to enjoy building interfaces using LLM's like Claude.ai.  I feel a lot more comfortable with this process than a few weeks ago, and was able to create this calculator interface with relative ease.  My favorite part about creating this calculator was designing the interactions, so that users would recieve visual feedback when pressing a button.  I also really enjoyed getting to design the interface to make the calculator of my dreams!
